  &quot;It is not the critic who counts;
  not the man who points out how
  the strong man stumbles, or where
  the doer of deeds could have done
  them better. The credit belongs to
  the man who is actually in the
  arena, whose face is marred by
  dust and sweat and blood; who
  strives valiantly; who errs, who
  comes short again and again,
  because there is no effort without
  error and shortcoming; but who does
  actually strive to do the deeds;
  who knows great enthusiasms, the
  great devotions; who spends himself
  in a worthy cause; who at the best
  knows in the end the triumph of high
  achievement, and who at the worst,
  if he fails, at least fails while
  daring greatly, so that his place
  shall never be with those cold and
  timid souls who neither know victory
  nor defeat.&quot;
